RandomBooleanCircuits
=================================================

This package was built to investigate the use of Novelty Search to find novel behaviours from small modifications of
Boolean logic circuits with a view to using similar methods to explore plasmid circuits for synthetic biology. It
implements all experiments and analysis used in "Exploring the potential of a Boolean Circuit with Novelty Search" by
Rainford et al. Instructions for installation and reimplementation are provided before code documentation for all
classes and functions.
